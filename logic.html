<p><b> Symbols used are: </b></p>
<p>	1. ~ for negation <br>
	2. V for OR <br>
	3. ^ for AND <br>
	4. > for implication.<br> 
	</p>
<h2>First Question:</h2>
<h4>Instructions to follow while giving input:</h4>
<pre>   1.If NEGATION is present in the propositional formulae it should be written as (~p).
   2.If OR is present in the propositional formulae it should be written as (pVq).
   3.If AND is present in the propositional formulae it should be written as (p^q).
   4.If IMPLICATION is present in the propositional formulae it should be written as (p>q).
  </pre>
<h4>Assumptions:</h4>
<pre>   1.The whole propositional formula is well formed and fully parenthesized.
   2.The whole propositional formulae should be entered only in one line.
   3.The input to this program should be a propositional logical formula in infix notation.
</pre>
<h4>Test Cases:</h4>
<pre>Test case 1:<br>
	(~((~q)^(~(~p))))<br>
	Memory used: 440 bytes.
	Time taken For running:0.002<br><br>

Test case 2:<br>
	(((p>q)^((~q)Vs))V(p>s))<br>
	Memory used: 587 bytes.
	Time taken For running:0.002<br><br>
	

Test case 3:<br>
	((~(~((~(((~(p^q))Vq)^m))>l)))Vp)<br>
	Memory used: 776 bytes.
	Time taken For running:0.003<br>
</pre>
<h2>Second Question:</h2>
<h4>Instructions to follow while giving input:</h4>
<pre>     1.First line: n (number of statements)
     2.Next n lines: <statement>/<rule>/line1/line2(existence of line1 and line2 will be dependent on the rule)
     3.The rules should be entered in the following manner:
		1. P (representing premise)
		2. ^i/line1/line2 (representing and introduction)
		3. ^en1/line1 (representing and elimination, here n1 is 1 or 2 depending on the proof we want) 
		4. Vin1/line1 (representing or introduction, here n1 is 1 or 2 depending on the proof we want)
		5. >e/line1/line2 (representing implication elimination)
		6. MT/line1/line2 (representing modus tollens)
</pre>
<h4>Assumptions:</h4>
<pre>	 1. Line number starts from 1. 
	 2. <statement> should be perfectly parenthesized, 
		e.g. ((a ∧ b) ∧ c) is valid, (a ∧ b) ∧ c is invalid, ((a ∧ b)) is invalid, (a ∧ b) is valid, (a ∧ b ∧ c) is invalid, p is valid, (p) is invalid. 
	 3. ¬ can be succeeded by a literal or ‘(‘ only. 
</pre>
<h4>Test Cases:</h4>
<pre>Test case 1:

	9
	((p>q)^(h>r))/P
	(~r)/P
	p/P
	(h>r)/^e2/1
	(~h)/MT/4/2
	(p>q)/^e1/1
	q/>e/6/3
	(pVq)/Vi2/7
	(p^q)/^i/3/7
	Memory used: 684 bytes.
	Time taken for running:0.001

Test case 2:

	8
	(t>(p^(q^(r>s))))/P
	t/P
	(p^(q^(r>s)))/>e/1/2
	(q^(r>s))/^e2/3
	(r>s)/^e2/4
	(~s)/P
	(~r)/MT/5/6
	((~r)V(~(~(k>t))))/Vi1/7
	Memory used: 868 bytes.
	Time taken for running:0.001
